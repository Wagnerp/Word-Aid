# Word-Aid

A word listing program that can work cooperatiivly with Special Access to Windows and Clicker 5.  As the user types words starting with the letter(s) typed are presented for selection in strict alphabetical order from a lexicon of words, the abc lists.  After a space or punctuation words from a topic list are presented to the user.

The lists can be accessed by the keyboard or mouse and the list and/or selected words can be spoken using SAPI text-to-speech.  New words can be added to the list byt the user or helper but this is not an automatic process.  Wordlists can be built from text files and the lists can be edited.

This program was freely available on www.oatsoft.org until its closure in 2018.
